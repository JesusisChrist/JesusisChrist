1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,210
If you could go back to the city of Jerusalem
in Bible times, the biggest thing you'd
如果你能回到圣经时代的耶路撒冷城，你会看到的最大的东西

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,770
see, is the temple.
就是圣殿。

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,650
This beautiful building was designed by King
David and built by King Solomon; and
这座美丽的建筑由大卫王设计，所罗门王建造；

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,660
they believed it was the home of the God of
the universe.
他们相信这是宇宙之神的家。

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,810
Wait, I thought God's home was in heaven.
等等，我以为神的家在天堂。

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,800
Well, the whole point of this earthly temple,
is that it's the place that overlaps with
嗯，这座地上圣殿的全部意义在于，它是与

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,340
God's heavenly home.
神天家重合的地方。

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,720
The temple is where God lives and rules all creation as king.
圣殿是上帝居住的地方，他以君王统治所有受造之物。

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
That's cool.
这很酷。

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,260
But even Solomon who built the temple didn’t
believe that his temple
但即使是建造圣殿的所罗门也不相信他的圣殿

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,780
could contain the God of the universe.
能容纳宇宙之神。

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,780
Right?
对么？

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,800
Yeah, the building was just a symbol, that pointed to the fact that all creation is God's temple
是的，这座建筑只是一个象征，表明所有受造物都是神的殿

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
temple.
圣殿。

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,489
And that is actually what the first page of
the Bible, Genesis, is all about.
这实际上就是圣经的开始，创世记的内容。

16
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:49,489
Really?
真的吗？

17
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,100
It says that creation is God's temple?
它说创造物是上帝的圣殿？

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,840
Well, it doesn't need to say it; the whole story shows it.
好吧，这不需要说； 整个故事都说明了这一点。

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,809
God creates an ordered world out of a dark wasteland
上帝通过连续 7 天的讲话，从一片黑暗的荒地中创造出一个有序的世界

20
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,370
by speaking in series of seven days.
上帝通过连续 7 天的讲话，从一片黑暗的荒地中创造出一个有序的世界

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,650
Then on the seventh day, God's presence fills creation as he
然后在第七天，当上帝开始休息时，

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,700
takes up his rest and rule.
祂的同在充满了受造之物

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,390
Similarly, the tabernacle–and later the temple–were built and dedicated in a series
同样，会幕——以及后来的圣殿——是在

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,070
of seven speeches and seven days
一系列七次演讲和七日

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,260
after which the priest or king could rest and rule in God’s presence.
之后建造和奉献的，之后祭司或国王可以在上帝的面前安息和统治。

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,800
Ah, so all of creation is where God intends to dwell.
啊，所以所有的受造之物都是上帝打算居住的地方。

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,670
It's like his temple.
就像他的殿。

28
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,670
Exactly.
正是如此。

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,370
Now, Turn the page to Genesis 2, and we get
another portrait of creation.
现在，到创世记 2 章，我们看到了另一幅关于创造的画像。

30
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,950
...This one focuses in on the land, and in
the center of the land is a region called
...这个重点是土地，在土地的中心是一个叫做

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,970
"Eden", which in Hebrew means "delight".
“伊甸园”的区域，在希伯来语中是“喜悦”的意思。

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,930
And in the middle of "Delight", God plants a garden in which God and humanity live together
在“喜悦”中间，上帝放置了一个上帝和人类共同生活的花园

33
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,930
together.

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,750
And that's why the temple was modeled afterthe garden 
这就是为什么这座寺庙以花园为蓝本。

35
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,700
Filled with imagery of gold and flowers, the Menorah symbolized the tree of life.
充满了黄金和花朵的意象，烛台象征着生命之树。

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,650
It's the place where God dwells with his people.
这是上帝与他的子民同住的地方。

37
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,990
Oh, Got it!
哦，明白了！

38
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,070
And check this out.
看看这个。

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,690
In the temple, the Israelite priests and Levites were to "to work
在圣殿里，以色列的祭司和利未人要

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,340
and to keep" the temple in God's presence.
在神的面前“建造并保守”圣殿。

41
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,690
This is exactly the job description given to humanity in the garden of Eden.
这正是伊甸园中人类被给予的工作。

42
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,380
So these humans were the first priests.
所以这些人类是第一批祭司。

43
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,609
But instead of ruling with God, they wanted to rule on their own terms, and they're
但他们不想与上帝一起统治，而是想按照自己的方式统治，他们被

44
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:15,990
exiled from the garden-temple.
逐出花园圣殿。

45
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,849
And, like Adam and Eve, Israel's leaders also wanted to rule on their own terms and
而且，像亚当和夏娃一样，以色列的领导人也想按照自己的方式统治，

46
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,709
they too were exiled.
他们也被流放。

47
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,390
The Temple was destroyed, and this left them wondering, did God give up on Israel?
圣殿被毁了，这让他们思考，上帝是否放弃了以色列？

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,299
Will God bring about a new creation?
上帝会带来新的创造吗？

49
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,719
Well, the biblical prophets anticipated the day when God would create a new temple, with
好吧，圣经的先知们预见到上帝会创造一个新的圣殿，

50
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,670
a new priesthood; that's when God's presence would fill all of creation.
与新的祭司的那一天； 那时上帝的同在会充满所有的受造物。

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,329
And when the Israelites returned to the land, they did rebuild the temple.
当以色列人返回这片土地时，他们确实重建了圣殿。

52
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,790
But that temple didn't turn out the way the prophets hoped.
但那座圣殿并没有像先知们所希望的那样发展。

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,160
In fact, later Israelite prophets said that this temple was hopelessly
事实上，后来的以色列先知说这座圣殿已经无可救药地

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
corrupt.
败坏了。

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,450
So they're still waiting, for the ultimate temple.
所以他们仍在等待，最终的殿。

56
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,609
And here we come to the story of Jesus.
在这里，我们来到耶稣的故事。

57
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,970
He said that through him God's presenceand

58

rule was coming to our world in a new way.

59
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,269
And presented himself as a new kind of priest.
并将自己展示为一种新型的祭司。

60
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,680
But Jesus wasn't a priest, and he didn't work in the Temple.
但耶稣不是祭司，他也没有在圣殿工作。

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,819
Right; Jesus said that God's presence, his
rest and rule, was filling the world through
对; 耶稣说上帝的同在，他的
安息和统治，正在通过

62
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,959
his own life, death, and resurrection.
他自己的生、死和复活充满世界。

63
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,270
Jesus was claiming that he was the true temple.
耶稣声称他是真正的圣殿。

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,920
And this new temple would expand out to include all of creation.
这座新的圣殿会扩展到包括所有的创造。

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,719
That is a really big claim!
这是一个非常大胆的宣告！

66
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,349
And it got bigger!
还不止这些！

67
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,480
After his resurrection, Jesus said that God's
presence would come
耶稣复活后说，上帝的同在

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,230
to dwell in and among his followers, so that
they could become mini-temples.
会在他的追随者里面和中间，使他们成为小型的圣殿。

69
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,069
Communities of people where God rests and rules.
上帝安息和统治的人们的社区。

70
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,109
Exactly.
确切地。

71
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,739
This is the Bible’s vision of the church,
which is described as a temple.
这是圣经对教会的异象，
教会被描述为圣殿。

72
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,139
Not a building, but people.
不是建筑物，而是人。

73
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,709
Like when Peter says "you all are living
stones built up as a temple for God's Spirit to dwell".
就像彼得说: 你们来到主面前，也就像活石，被建造成为灵宫，
作圣洁的祭司，藉着耶稣基督奉献神所悦纳的灵祭。 

74
00:03:58,709 --> 00:03:59,889
to dwell".

75
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,459
So at the end of the biblical story, do we
ever get a new physical temple?
所以在圣经故事的结尾，我们有
没有得到一座新的实体的圣殿？

76
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,859
Well, not exactly.
嗯，不完全是。

77
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,310
What we see is a renewed cosmic temple, just
like in Genesis one.
我们看到的是一个更新的宇宙圣殿，
就像创世记一章一样。

78
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,840
And this new creation doesn't need a building
because through Jesus, all creation is
而这个新创造不需要建筑，
因为通过耶稣，所有的受造之物

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,510
now the place where God rests and rules the
world with his people.
现在都是上帝与他的子民一起安息和统治世界的地方。
